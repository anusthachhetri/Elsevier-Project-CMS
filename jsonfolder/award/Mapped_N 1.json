Currently,, there is no cure for either â and current treatment options are extremely limited. Dr Sovan Sarkar of the University of Birmingham is carrying out laboratory tests to find out whether existing therapies used for other health conditions could help slow the progression of symptoms that affect the nervous system in NPC1 and WS. His ultimate goal is to develop an effective new treatment strategy that could help improve the quality of life and extend life expectancy for children born with these devastating conditions.","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-06T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}},"source":"https://action.org.uk/research/testing-new-treatment-strategy-could-help-children-two-rare-neurodegenerative-diseases"}],"keyword":[{"language":"en","value":"not found","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-06T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"licenseInformation":[{"abstract":{"language":"en","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-06T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"},"value":"not found"},"source":"https://action.org.uk/about-us/policies/privacy-policy"}],"funds":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"not found","hasPart":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"not found","budget":[{"currency":"GBP","amount":0}]}],"title":[{"language":"en","value":"Testing a new treatment strategy that could help children with two rare neurodegenerative diseases","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-06T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"acronym":"not found","endDate":"2027-10-31T00:00:00","hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"GBR","addressRegion":"not found","addressLocality":"not found","addressPostalCode":"not found","postOfficeBoxNumber":"not found","streetAddress":"not found"},"link":"not found","budget":[{"currency":"GBP","amount":0}],"status":"OPEN"}],"fundingDetail":{"installment":[{"index":0,"grantAwardInstallmentId":1,"financialYearStart":0,"financialYearEnd":0,"fundedAmount":[{"currency":"GBP","amount":0}]}],"fundingTotal":[{"currency":"GBP","amount":249999}]},"awardeeDetail":[{"activityType":"research organization","affiliationOf":[{"awardeePersonId":"83188474_P_0","emailAddress":"not found","familyName":"Sarkar","fundingBodyPersonId":"not found","givenName":"Sovan","identifier":[{"type":"ORCID","value":"not found"}],"initials":"S.","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Sovan Sarkar"}],"role":"PI","sourceRole":"not found"}],"awardeeAffiliationId":"83188474_A_0","departmentName":[{"language":"en","value":"Department of Cancer and Genomic Sciences","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-06T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"fundingBodyOrganizationId":"not found","fundingTotal":[{"amount":0,"currency":"GBP"}],"hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"GBR","addressLocality":"not found","addressPostalCode":"not found","addressRegion":"not found","postOfficeBoxNumber":"not found","streetAddress":"not found"},"identifier":[{"type":"ROR","value":"not found"}],"link":"not found","name":[{"language":"en","value":"University of Birmingham"}],"role":"COORDINATOR","sourceRole":"not found","vatNumber":"not found"},{"activityType":"research organization","affiliationOf":[{"awardeePersonId":"83188474_P_1","emailAddress":"not found","familyName":"Barrett","fundingBodyPersonId":"not found","givenName":"Timothy G","identifier":[{"type":"ORCID","value":"not found"}],"initials":"T.G.","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Timothy G Barrett"}],"role":"COPI","sourceRole":"not found"}],"awardeeAffiliationId":"83188474_A_1","departmentName":[{"language":"en","value":"Department of Endocrinology","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-06T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"fundingBodyOrganizationId":"not found","fundingTotal":[{"amount":0,"currency":"GBP"}],"hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"GBR","addressLocality":"not found","addressPostalCode":"not found","addressRegion":"not found","postOfficeBoxNumber":"not found","streetAddress":"not found"},"identifier":[{"type":"ROR","value":"not found"}],"link":"not found","name":[{"language":"en","value":"not found"}],"role":"PARTICIPANT","sourceRole":"not found","vatNumber":"not found"}],"classification":[{"type":"Annotation","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Cell Biology","identifier":{"value":"1307","type":"ASJC"}}},{"type":"Annotation","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Molecular Medicine","identifier":{"value":"1313","type":"ASJC"}}},{"type":"Annotation","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Neurology (Clinical)","identifier":{"value":"2708","type":"ASJC"}}},{"type":"Annotation","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","identifier":{"value":"2804","type":"ASJC"}}}],"relatedOpportunity":[{"grantOpportunityId":0,"fundingBodyOpportunityId":"not found","title":[{"language":"en","value":"Action Medical Research Project Grants in Child Health 2025","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-06T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"description":"Action Medical Research is a leading UK-wide charity dedicated to saving and changing childrenâs lives through medical research.
