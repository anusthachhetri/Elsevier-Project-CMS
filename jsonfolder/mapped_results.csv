synopsis,"Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease and Wolfram syndrome (WS) are both rare,, life-limiting neurodegenerative diseases that mainly affect children. Currently,, there is no cure for either – and current treatment options are extremely limited. Dr Sovan Sarkar of the University of Birmingham is carrying out laboratory tests to find out whether existing therapies used for other health conditions could help slow the progression of symptoms that affect the nervous system in NPC1 and WS. His ultimate goal is to develop an effective new treatment strategy that could help improve the quality of life and extend life expectancy for children born with these devastating conditions.",9
