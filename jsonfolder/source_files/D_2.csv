synopsis,"Insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas are what are destroyed or become dysfunctional in diabetes. To restore this functionality, methods have previously included to transplant isolated islets from donor patients, however this has been met with problems of survival of lifelong immune suppression for the patient, and the survival of the implanted islets themselves. Several research groups have made pioneering progress over the last decade by using stem cells originally from the patient, that have a capacity to become any cell in the body, and generating beta cell ‘like’ cells using a cocktail of various compounds over multiple stages of beta cell development in the laboratory.What these cells lack however is their ‘incomplete’ levels of maturity to become a fully functional beta cell, as measured by the amount of insulin produced and their capacity to secrete it into the bloodstream. We hypothesise that the missing element are pathways that regulates the expression of key beta cell genes (and therefore beta cell maturation) in the body, known as epigenetic pathways.We will screen a large number of commercially-available compounds that target these epigenetic pathways known as ‘epidrugs’ and assess their ability to enhance human beta cell maturation in a cellular model system. Our goal is to interrogate the role that these novel epigenetic pathways have on beta cell functional maturation and ultimately to assess their ability to enhance the functionality of stem cell-derived beta cells prior to transplantation into diabetic patients",9
