synopsis,"The majority of people with diabetes live also with overweight or obesity. One third of people living with diabetes are affected by cardiovascular disease, namely heart attacks and strokes. This is due to build up of atherosclerosis plaques (accumulations of fats, cholesterol and immune cells) in artery walls. These plaques can cause arteries to narrow, blocking the blood flow and leading to a lack of blood supply e.g. to the heart (causing heart attacks) or to the brain (causing strokes). Semaglutide is a medication based on gut hormones and it was initially approved for the treatment of diabetes.Semaglutide is now also licensed for weight loss. Some studies have shown beneficial effects for the cardiovascular system although the exact mechanism is not fully understood. Inflammation, where the immune system is activated to get rid of irritants and infection, is a normal process that exists to get rid of these irritants. Low grade inflammation is also associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis.  My hypothesis is that semaglutide has a beneficial cardiovascular profile via reducing inflammation and thereby slowing down atherosclerosis and that this is a direct effect of semaglutide and not merely a consequence of weight loss.",9
