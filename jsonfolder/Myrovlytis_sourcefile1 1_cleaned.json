At present, Amsterdam UMC is a national referral site, a centre of expertise for BHD, overseeing a cohort of 400 BHD patients from 220 different families. Our clinical studies led to the introduction of new national guidelines for BHD screening and revealed limited correlations among the occurrence fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts, or spontaneous pneumothorax, and the incidence of RCC.BHD is a predisposition to renal cell carcinoma (RCC) caused by inherited mutations of the Folliculin (FLCN) gene.The lifetime risk for BHD patients to develop RCC is approximately 20%. Timely diagnosis of BHD by DNA analysis helps timely detection of RCC, permitting nephron-sparing surgery. Nevertheless, BHD patients require life-long screening. While early discovery and resection of BHD-RCCs provides a valuable treatment option for developed\ncountries, surgery complications may pose risks.Therapeutic treatment strategies for BHD-RCC are inadequate. Here, we aim to exploit the human-derived cancer cell models that we and others have previously generated to discover and validate personalized treatment options for BHD-RCC. For the first time, we will use a recently developed technology called CRISPR screening to identify drug targets that are uniquely relevant for BHD patients. Furthermore, we will use this approach to explore a promising new drug used for hereditary RCC treatment in the VHL kidney cancer predisposition syndrome, to repurpose it for BHD therapy. We will investigate combination therapies using human BHD cancer cell line models and should identify new, preclinically validated therapeutic options for BHD-RCC. Therapeutic strategies will be evaluated for translation to the clinic by our Amsterdam UMC urologists, medical oncologists and the Drug Rediscovery Protocol team (Drug Rediscovery Protocol","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2/18/2025","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}},"source":"https://myrovlytistrust.org/currently-funded-research-bhd"}],"keyword":[{"language":"en","value":"not found","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2/18/2025","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"licenseInformation":[{"abstract":{"language":"en","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2/18/2025","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"},"value":"© myrovlytis trust.
