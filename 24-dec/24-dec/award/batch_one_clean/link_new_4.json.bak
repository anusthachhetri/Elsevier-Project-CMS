Long-term complications include diabetes and increased risk of ovarian cancer. PCOS is the major cause of female infertility in the Philippines with ~4.5M Filipinas living with PCOS, however healthcare for them is poor, focusing on surgical removal of ovaries. This has a devastating impact on the women, affecting their relationships (many cannot find or keep a husband), has its own health risks and is ruinously expensive - an ovariectomy costs the equivalent of 4 months salary for an office worker and 2 years salary for an unskilled worker.\n\nWe are developing Hupela-PCOS-Filipina a programme to greatly improve the health outcomes of women living with PCOS in the Philippines. It has three elements:\n\n1. Free Education Programme (EP) on self-care for PCOS without drugs or surgery.\n\n2. Commercial programme to sell a Nutritional Supplement (NS) for PCOS treatment.\n\n3. Develop Research Partnerships (RP) to advance healthcare for Filipinas with PCOS.\n\nThis is a six month study to assess the feasibility of our project. The care protocols have been tested and proven to be safe and effective and we are now developing a business and technology plan (BTP) covering the next five years. This study will help us ensure the plan is sound through three types of activity:\n\nPerform field and investigative work to test our core assumptions on our potential market, customer demographics, our value proposition, the business model, profitability, scalability, potential impacts on us, our customers and their families and our partners and potential risks.\nModify the BTP using knowledge gained in Step 1.\nFurther develop relationships with partners needed to deliver a successful, sustainable programme in the Philippines.\nThe proposed project aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 4, respectively.\n\nThe project partners, Ludger and Masuna have collaborated on social enterprise projects to improve the health and wealth of Filipinos living in poverty. Over the past six years we have set up two businesses with a social mission in the Philippines. This project is a natural extension of that work. To promote local economic development and ensure the success and sustainability of the programme, we will also train and commission local women to deliver support groups and educational sessions for women with PCOS."},"source":"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=133966"}],"keyword":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"licenseInformation":[{"abstract":{"language":"en","value":"OGL"},"source":"https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/"}],"funds":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"NOT FOUND","hasPart":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"NOT FOUND","budget":[{"currency":"GBP","amount":58791}]}],"title":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"acronym":"NOT FOUND","hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"GBR","addressRegion":"NOT FOUND","addressLocality":"Swindon","addressPostalCode":"SN2 1ET","postOfficeBoxNumber":"NOT FOUND","streetAddress":"Polaris House"},"link":"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=133966","budget":[{"currency":"GBP","amount":58791}],"status":"CLOSED"}],"fundingDetail":{"installment":[{"index":0,"grantAwardInstallmentId":1,"financialYearStart":0,"financialYearEnd":0,"fundedAmount":[{"currency":"GBP","amount":58791}]}],"fundingTotal":[{"currency":"GBP","amount":58791}]},"awardeeDetail":[{"awardeeAffiliationId":"800133970_A_0","name":[{"language":"en","value":"LUDGER LIMITED"}],"role":"PARTICIPANT","fundingTotal":[{"currency":"GBP","amount":58791}],"fundingBodyOrganizationId":"NOT FOUND","vatNumber":"NOT FOUND","link":"NOT FOUND","hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"GBR","addressRegion":"NOT FOUND","addressLocality":"NOT FOUND","addressPostalCode":"NOT FOUND","postOfficeBoxNumber":"NOT FOUND","streetAddress":"NOT FOUND"},"identifier":[{"type":"DUNS","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"departmentName":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"activityType":"NOT FOUND","affiliationOf":[{"awardeePersonId":"800133970_P_0","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Paul Plume"}],"role":"PI","initials":"P","givenName":"Paul","familyName":"Plume","emailAddress":"NOT FOUND","identifier":[{"type":"ORCID","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"fundingBodyPersonId":"NOT FOUND"}]}],"classification":[{"type":"Classification","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Medical and Health Sciences","orgSpecificClassification":"NOT FOUND","identifier":{"type":"ASJC","value":"1304"}}},{"type":"Classification","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Medicine","orgSpecificClassification":"NOT FOUND","identifier":{"type":"ASJC","value":"2700"}}}],"relatedOpportunity":[{"grantOpportunityId":0,"fundingBodyOpportunityId":"NOT FOUND","title":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"description":"NOT FOUND"}],"relatedFunder":{"leadFunder":{"fundingBodyId":0,"sourceId":"NOT FOUND","sourceText":"UK Research and Innovation"},"hasFunder":[{"fundingBodyId":0,"sourceId":"NOT FOUND","sourceText":"UK Research and Innovation"},{"fundingBodyId":0,"sourceId":"NOT FOUND","sourceText":"Innovate UK"}]},"hasProvenance":{"wasAttributedTo":"SUP004","derivedFrom":"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=133966","createdOn":"2024-12-03T00:00:00","lastUpdateOn":"2024-12-03T00:00:00","contactPoint":"robin.bhandari@highwirepress.com","version":"1","hidden":false,"defunct":false,"status":"UPDATW"}}
