Her projects aim at investigations of the mechanisms of newborn brain injury, development of cotside monitoring and neuroprotective strategies. Translational research is an important theme of her projects, involving complementary experimental studies in the animal models and clinical studies in preterm infants to examine cerebral pathophysiology. She has pioneered the research utilising Spatially Resolved Spectroscopy in Australia to measure brain oxygenation in babies. Her publications demonstrate a strategic set of studies for the identification of circulatory factors that contribute to neonatal brain injury, and testing new biomarkers and clinical interventions."},"source":"https://www.racp.edu.au/foundation/our-recipients/awards/career-development-fellowships"}],"keyword":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"licenseInformation":[{"abstract":{"language":"en","value":"Â© 2024 - Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP)  |  ABN 90 270 343 237 and ACN 000 039 047."},"source":"NOT FOUND"}],"funds":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"NOT FOUND","hasPart":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"NOT FOUND","budget":[{"currency":"AUD","amount":100000}]}],"title":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"acronym":"NOT FOUND","hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"NZL","addressRegion":"New Zealand","addressLocality":"NOT FOUND","addressPostalCode":"NOT FOUND","postOfficeBoxNumber":"NOT FOUND","streetAddress":"NOT FOUND"},"link":"NOT FOUND","budget":[{"currency":"AUD","amount":100000}],"status":"OPEN"}],"fundingDetail":{"installment":[{"index":0,"grantAwardInstallmentId":1,"financialYearStart":0,"financialYearEnd":0,"fundedAmount":[{"currency":"AUD","amount":100000}]}],"fundingTotal":[{"currency":"AUD","amount":100000}]},"awardeeDetail":[{"awardeeAffiliationId":"802517657_A_0","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Department of Paediatrics, Monash University"}],"role":"PARTICIPANT","fundingTotal":[{"currency":"AUD","amount":100000}],"fundingBodyOrganizationId":"NOT FOUND","vatNumber":"NOT FOUND","link":"NOT FOUND","hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"NZL","addressRegion":"NOT FOUND","addressLocality":"NOT FOUND","addressPostalCode":"NOT FOUND","postOfficeBoxNumber":"NOT FOUND","streetAddress":"NOT FOUND"},"identifier":[{"type":"DUNS","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"departmentName":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"activityType":"NOT FOUND","affiliationOf":[{"awardeePersonId":"802517657_P_0","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Flora Wong"}],"role":"PI","initials":"F","givenName":"Flora","familyName":"Wong","emailAddress":"NOT FOUND","identifier":[{"type":"ORCID","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"fundingBodyPersonId":"NOT FOUND"}]}],"classification":[{"type":"Classification","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Pediatrics and Child Health","orgSpecificClassification":"NOT FOUND","identifier":{"type":"ASJC","value":"2735"}}},{"type":"Classification","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Biophysics","orgSpecificClassification":"NOT FOUND","identifier":{"type":"ASJC","value":"1304"}}}],"relatedOpportunity":[{"grantOpportunityId":0,"fundingBodyOpportunityId":"NOT FOUND","title":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"description":"NOT FOUND"}],"relatedFunder":{"leadFunder":{"fundingBodyId":0,"sourceId":"NOT FOUND","sourceText":"RACP Foundation"},"hasFunder":[{"fundingBodyId":0,"sourceId":"NOT FOUND","sourceText":"RACP Foundation"}]},"hasProvenance":{"wasAttributedTo":"SUP004","derivedFrom":"https://www.racp.edu.au/foundation/our-recipients/awards/career-development-fellowships","createdOn":"2024-12-03T00:00:00","lastUpdateOn":"2024-12-03T00:00:00","contactPoint":"robin.bhandari@highwirepress.com","version":"1","hidden":false,"defunct":false,"status":"UPDATE"}}
