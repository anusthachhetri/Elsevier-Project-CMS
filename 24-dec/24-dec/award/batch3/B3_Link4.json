Also known as cancer of the uterus or womb, the number is rising and the cancer has been linked with obesity and diabetes. Early detection gives women the best chance of survival, but as yet there is no screening programme anywhere in the world for endometrial cancer.We want to explore the theory that the mix of bacteria or 'microbiome' present in a woman's vagina and uterus can predict whether they are at high risk of having this cancer. Using samples from New Zealand women, we will confirm if certain microbiome signatures do predict risk. Then we will compare and select the best tools and methods that could be quickly picked up for use in healthcare testing by local laboratories. The results from this project will help us design a national endometrial cancer screening trial as well as boost understanding of the underlying causes of endometrial cancer."},"source":"https://www.cancerresearchtrustnz.org.nz/funded-projects"}],"keyword":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"licenseInformation":[{"abstract":{"language":"en","value":"All content Â© 2024 Cancer Research Trust NZ."},"source":"https://www.cancerresearchtrustnz.org.nz/funded-projects"}],"funds":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"NOT FOUND","hasPart":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"NOT FOUND","budget":[{"currency":"NZD","amount":79770}]}],"title":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"acronym":"NOT FOUND","hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"NZL","addressRegion":"NOT FOUND","addressLocality":"NOT FOUND","addressPostalCode":"NOT FOUND","postOfficeBoxNumber":"NOT FOUND","streetAddress":"NOT FOUND"},"link":"NOT FOUND","budget":[{"currency":"NZD","amount":79770}],"status":"CLOSED"}],"fundingDetail":{"installment":[{"index":0,"grantAwardInstallmentId":1,"financialYearStart":0,"financialYearEnd":0,"fundedAmount":[{"currency":"NZD","amount":79770}]}],"fundingTotal":[{"currency":"NZD","amount":79770}]},"awardeeDetail":[{"awardeeAffiliationId":"809929536_A_0","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, University of Auckland, Auckland"}],"role":"COORDINATOR","fundingTotal":[{"currency":"NZD","amount":79770}],"fundingBodyOrganizationId":"NOT FOUND","vatNumber":"NOT FOUND","link":"NOT FOUND","hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"NZL","addressRegion":"NOT FOUND","addressLocality":"NOT FOUND","addressPostalCode":"NOT FOUND","postOfficeBoxNumber":"NOT FOUND","streetAddress":"NOT FOUND"},"identifier":[{"type":"DUNS","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"departmentName":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"activityType":"NOT FOUND","affiliationOf":[{"awardeePersonId":"809929536_P_0","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Cherie Blenkiron"}],"role":"PI","initials":"C","givenName":"Cherie","familyName":"Blenkiron","emailAddress":"NOT FOUND","identifier":[{"type":"ORCID","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"fundingBodyPersonId":"NOT FOUND"}]}],"classification":[{"type":"Classification","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Cancer Research","orgSpecificClassification":"NOT FOUND","identifier":{"type":"ASJC","value":"1306"}}},{"type":"Classification","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Anatomy","orgSpecificClassification":"NOT FOUND","identifier":{"type":"ASJC","value":"2702"}}},{"type":"Classification","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Radiology Nuclear Medicine and imaging","orgSpecificClassification":"NOT FOUND","identifier":{"type":"ASJC","value":"2741"}}},{"type":"Classification","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Molecular Medicine","orgSpecificClassification":"NOT FOUND","identifier":{"type":"ASJC","value":"1313"}}}],"relatedOpportunity":[{"grantOpportunityId":0,"fundingBodyOpportunityId":"NOT FOUND","title":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"description":"NOT FOUND"}],"relatedFunder":{"leadFunder":{"fundingBodyId":0,"sourceId":"NOT FOUND","sourceText":"Cancer Research Trust New Zealand"},"hasFunder":[{"fundingBodyId":0,"sourceId":"NOT FOUND","sourceText":"Cancer Research Trust New Zealand"}]},"hasProvenance":{"wasAttributedTo":"SUP004","derivedFrom":"https://www.cancerresearchtrustnz.org.nz/funded-projects","createdOn":"2024-11-18T15:42:08","lastUpdateOn":"2024-11-18T15:42:08","contactPoint":"robin.bhandari@highwirepress.com","version":"1","hidden":false,"defunct":false,"status":"UPDATE"}}
