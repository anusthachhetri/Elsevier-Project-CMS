In turn, Japan is the largest importer of Australian beef and lamb. With 32% of food produced for human consumption becoming waste, including rejection of entire shipments if bacterial growth is detected, this project aims to use the antibacterial pattern of insect wings to extend shelf-life and improve the quality, safety, and integrity of packaged food on an industrial scale, thereby reducing waste. Bio-mimetic antibacterial packaging will be developed by replicating the antibacterial pattern of insect wings into various polymeric materials. Professor Ivanova's antibacterial nanomaterials research and KAITEKI's platform enables the team to conduct cutting edge research into marketable products. The KAITEKI Institute was established by Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings as a think tank and global research institute to draw and realize desirable future society and environment and to partner with academic institutions, national laboratories and private entities to perform innovative research."},"source":"https://www.australiajapaninnovation.org/2021-grants"}],"keyword":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"licenseInformation":[{"abstract":{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"},"source":"NOT FOUND"}],"funds":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"NOT FOUND","hasPart":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"NOT FOUND","budget":[{"currency":"AUD","amount":145000}]}],"title":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"acronym":"NOT FOUND","hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"AUS","addressRegion":"Victoria","addressLocality":"Brighton","addressPostalCode":"3186","postOfficeBoxNumber":"NOT FOUND","streetAddress":"25 St James Park Drive"},"link":"https://www.australiajapaninnovation.org/2021-grants","budget":[{"currency":"AUD","amount":145000}],"status":"CLOSED"}],"fundingDetail":{"installment":[{"index":0,"grantAwardInstallmentId":1,"financialYearStart":0,"financialYearEnd":0,"fundedAmount":[{"currency":"AUD","amount":145000}]}],"fundingTotal":[{"currency":"AUD","amount":145000}]},"awardeeDetail":[{"awardeeAffiliationId":"802019431_A_0","name":[{"language":"en","value":"RMIT University"}],"role":"PARTICIPANT","fundingTotal":[{"currency":"AUD","amount":145000}],"fundingBodyOrganizationId":"NOT FOUND","vatNumber":"NOT FOUND","link":"NOT FOUND","hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"AUS","addressRegion":"NOT FOUND","addressLocality":"NOT FOUND","addressPostalCode":"NOT FOUND","postOfficeBoxNumber":"NOT FOUND","streetAddress":"NOT FOUND"},"identifier":[{"type":"DUNS","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"departmentName":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"activityType":"Research Organization","affiliationOf":[{"awardeePersonId":"802019431_P_0","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Elena Ivanova"}],"role":"PI","initials":"E","givenName":"Elena","familyName":"Ivanova","emailAddress":"NOT FOUND","identifier":[{"type":"ORCID","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"fundingBodyPersonId":"NOT FOUND"}]},{"awardeeAffiliationId":"802019431_A_1","name":[{"language":"en","value":"The KAITEKI Institute"}],"role":"PARTICIPANT","fundingTotal":[{"currency":"AUD","amount":145000}],"fundingBodyOrganizationId":"NOT FOUND","vatNumber":"NOT FOUND","link":"NOT FOUND","hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"AUS","addressRegion":"NOT FOUND","addressLocality":"NOT FOUND","addressPostalCode":"NOT FOUND","postOfficeBoxNumber":"NOT FOUND","streetAddress":"NOT FOUND"},"identifier":[{"type":"DUNS","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"departmentName":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"activityType":"Research Organization","affiliationOf":[{"awardeePersonId":"802019431_P_1","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Saita Soichiro"}],"role":"PI","initials":"S","givenName":"Saita","familyName":"Soichiro","emailAddress":"NOT FOUND","identifier":[{"type":"ORCID","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"fundingBodyPersonId":"NOT FOUND"}]}],"classification":[{"type":"Classification","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Materials Science","orgSpecificClassification":"NOT FOUND","identifier":{"type":"FOR","value":"2500"}}},{"type":"Classification","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Environmental Science","orgSpecificClassification":"NOT FOUND","identifier":{"type":"FOR","value":"2300"}}}],"relatedOpportunity":[{"grantOpportunityId":0,"fundingBodyOpportunityId":"NOT FOUND","title":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"description":"NOT FOUND"}],"relatedFunder":{"leadFunder":{"fundingBodyId":0,"sourceId":"NOT FOUND","sourceText":"Australia Japan Innovation Fund"},"hasFunder":[{"fundingBodyId":0,"sourceId":"NOT FOUND","sourceText":"Australia Japan Innovation Fund"}]},"hasProvenance":{"wasAttributedTo":"SUP004","derivedFrom":"https://www.australiajapaninnovation.org/2021-grants","createdOn":"2024-11-30T11:37:44","lastUpdateOn":"2024-11-30T11:37:44","contactPoint":"robin.bhandari@highwirepress.com","version":"0","hidden":false,"defunct":false,"status":"NEW"}}
