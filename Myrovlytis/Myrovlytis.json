FLCN deficient cells are known to exhibit alteration in gene expression, enzyme activity and cellular metabolism.Despite these important findings,key molecules to target for BHD kidney cancer therapy have not been identified. In this research project,we will identify molecules and signaling pathways that are specifically essential for FLCN deficient cells to survive and to form clinically significant tumours.To achieve this goal,we will conduct genome wide searches for genes that are necessary for tumour formation in FLCN deficient tissues using state of the art technology.This research will provide the basis for the development of more effective BHD kidney cancer specific therapeutics with fewer side effects","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-22T12:36:31","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}},"source":"https://myrovlytistrust.org/professor-masaya-baba/"}],"keyword":[{"language":"en","value":"not found","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-22T12:36:31","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"licenseInformation":[{"abstract":{"language":"en","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-22T12:36:31","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"},"value":"Â© myrovlytis trust"},"source":"https://myrovlytistrust.org/privacy-policy/"}],"funds":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"not found","hasPart":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"not found","budget":[{"amount":0,"currency":"GBP"}]}],"title":[{"language":"en","value":"not found","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-22T12:36:31","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"acronym":"not found","hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"GBR","addressRegion":"not found","addressLocality":"not found","addressPostalCode":"not found","postOfficeBoxNumber":"not found","streetAddress":"not found"},"link":"not found","budget":[{"amount":0,"currency":"GBP"}],"status":"OPEN"}],"fundingDetail":{"installment":[{"index":0,"grantAwardInstallmentId":1,"financialYearStart":0,"financialYearEnd":0,"fundedAmount":[{"amount":0,"currency":"GBP"}]}],"fundingTotal":[{"amount":0,"currency":"GBP"}]},"awardeeDetail":[{"activityType":"research organization","affiliationOf":[{"awardeePersonId":"81149607_P_0","emailAddress":"not found","familyName":"Baba","fundingBodyPersonId":"not found","givenName":"Masaya","identifier":[{"type":"ORCID","value":"not found"}],"initials":"M.","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Masaya Baba"}],"role":"PI","sourceRole":"not found"}],"awardeeAffiliationId":"81149607_A_0","departmentName":[{"language":"en","value":"not found","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-22T12:36:31","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"fundingBodyOrganizationId":"not found","fundingTotal":[{"amount":0,"currency":"GBP"}],"identifier":[{"type":"ROR","value":"not found"}],"link":"not found","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Kumamoto University,Japan"}],"role":"COORDINATOR","sourceRole":"not found","vatNumber":"not found"}],"classification":[{"type":"Annotation","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Oncology","identifier":{"value":"2730","type":"ASJC"}}},{"type":"Annotation","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Genetics","identifier":{"value":"1311","type":"ASJC"}}},{"type":"Annotation","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Molecular Biology","identifier":{"value":"1312","type":"ASJC"}}},{"type":"Annotation","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Cell Biology","identifier":{"value":"1307","type":"ASJC"}}},{"type":"Annotation","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Pharmacology","identifier":{"value":"3004","type":"ASJC"}}},{"type":"Annotation","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Immunology and Allergy","identifier":{"value":"2723","type":"ASJC"}}}],"relatedOpportunity":[{"grantOpportunityId":0,"fundingBodyOpportunityId":"not found","title":[{"language":"en","value":"not found","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-02-22T12:36:31","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"description":"not found"}],"relatedFunder":{"leadFunder":{"fundingBodyId":85864273,"sourceId":"not found","sourceText":"not found"},"hasFunder":[{"fundingBodyId":85864273,"sourceId":"not found","sourceText":"not found"}]},"hasProvenance":{"wasAttributedTo":"SUP005","derivedFrom":"https://myrovlytistrust.org/currently-funded-research-bhd","createdOn":"2025-02-22T12:36:31","lastUpdateOn":"2025-02-22T12:36:31","contactPoint":"Fundingdatateam@mpslimited.com","version":"0","hidden":false,"defunct":false,"status":"NEW"},"options":{"additionalProp1":{},"additionalProp2":{},"additionalProp3":{}}}
