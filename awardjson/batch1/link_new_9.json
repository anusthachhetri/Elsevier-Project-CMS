			"value": "It is commonly said that the average age of the general population is increasing and will continue to increase in the years to come. One unfortunate outcome is an increase in health problems. Of concern are events such as heart attacks or limb damage due to lack of oxygen (typically associated with diabetes). After such events, there is an attempt by the body to form new blood vessels to areas that have been deprived of oxygen and nutrients. However, both aging and diabetes are associated with a decrease in formation of new blood vessels. The purpose of this research project is to see if we can increase the amount of new blood vessels formed, following events that deprive muscles and body tissue of oxygen and nutrients, by using a novel compound that we have, to promote the release of substances that have been associated with vessel formation.It is commonly said that the average age of the general population is increasing and will continue to increase in the years to come.
