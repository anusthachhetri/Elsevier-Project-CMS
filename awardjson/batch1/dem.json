			"value": "Research question Is it feasible to undertake a randomised trial of oral ibuprofen added to usual analgesia to reduce pain during the first five days after elective major gut surgery, compared to usual analgesia alone? Background One in three of the 50,000 patients who undergo major gut surgery in the NHS each year experience severe pain which may last several days after surgery. There is good evidence that ibuprofen, a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID), may prevent severe pain after major gut surgery. However, only around one in five patients receive ibuprofen because of the widespread belief that it causes gastric bleeding, anastomotic leak and acute kidney injury in this patient group. These complications are not unusual after surgery even when NSAIDs are not prescribed, and the evidence that ibuprofen increases complication rates is contradictory. The drive to reduce opioid dependence after surgery makes it more important than ever to make full use of effective non-opioid analgesics. Severe pain after surgery is not merely a temporary symptom but associated with serious post-operative harm. Patients tell us that healthcare staff repeatedly under-estimate the importance of pain relief after surgery. We need a large randomised trial to confirm whether ibuprofen provides safe and effective analgesia for low-risk patients undergoing major gut surgery. However, research experts are concerned that poor clinician equipoise would make a definitive trial undeliverable. A feasibility trial is needed to confirm patients and doctors would participate, and with high levels of intervention compliance. This would inform the design of a definitive trial, and clearly demonstrate willingness to participate and randomise patients across a representative sample of NHS hospitals. Research questions 1. Is a randomised trial of oral ibuprofen feasible for patients undergoing elective major gut surgery? 2. Will patients receive the treatment allocated? 3. What are the views of patients and doctors who do and don t agree to take part in this trial? 4. What are the summary statistics for the key patient-centred outcomes? 5. What are the rates of anastomotic leak, acute kidney injury and gastric bleeding? Would a larger trial be considered safe? 6. Can we robustly mask patients and clinicians to the allocated treatment group in an open-label trial? Methods We will recruit 200 adult patients undergoing major elective gut surgery with anastomosis in 10 NHS hospitals to an open-label randomised feasibility trial of oral ibuprofen (400mg TDS for five days after surgery) in addition to usual post-operative analgesia. We will use masked assessment of feasibility, patient, and safety outcomes to compare additional use of ibuprofen to usual analgesia alone. We will exclude the following patients at greater risk of NSAID associated harm. Timetable 24-month project: Pre-funding: Site recruitment, protocol preparation 6 months: Ethics and MHRA approvals, site set-up 12 months: patient recruitment 6 months: completion of follow-up, data analysis and dissemination Impact and dissemination Our findings will address our key objective of securing funding for a large definitive clinical trial. We will also disseminate our findings via social media, mainstream media, and peer reviewed scientific journals."
