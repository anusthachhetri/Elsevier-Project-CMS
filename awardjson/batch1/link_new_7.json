			"value": "The current growth in performance of electronic components in engineering systems increases the demand for the design and improvement of existing cooling systems. Timely and efficient heat dissipation provides long life of thermal systems and comfortable working conditions for all components. In this regard, the task of modeling passive cooling systems for components of electronic devices is currently relevant. To intensify heat transfer in such cases, additional elements are introduced into cooling systems: for example, porous layers and working fluids with different properties. Numerical studies in this vein are an effective tool for studying and predicting the performance of engineering systems, allowing to take into account a wide range of determining parameters, both internal characteristics of the system and external factors (ambient temperature, types of heating, etc.). \nThis project proposes a solution to the problem of optimization of passive cooling systems for power sources in the presence of porous layers and working media with temperature-dependent thermophysical properties. The features of heat exchange and convective flow in closed two-dimensional and three-dimensional regions with solid structure and liquid will be studied. Taking into account the peculiarities of boundary conditions and models of thermal interaction in porous medium will allow to improve passive cooling systems and to obtain a set of recommendations for heat exchange intensification. Scientific novelty consists in the complex approach to modeling of convective heat transfer in closed areas with joint consideration of the influence of many factors, which was not studied earlier.\nThe studied direction of research belongs to the priority directions of development of science, technology and engineering in the Russian Federation, which is associated with the transition to environmentally friendly and resource-saving energy, increasing the efficiency of production and deep processing of hydrocarbon raw materials, the formation of new sources, methods of transportation and storage of energy. The results obtained on the basis of own program codes in C++ programming language will expand the range of fundamental knowledge in the field of fluid and gas mechanics. \n\nExpected results\nThe following is expected as the results of the project:\n1. 3 articles will be published in leading Russian and international scientific editions, including 2 article in the editions indexed in Web of Science Core Collection or Scopus databases and included in Q1-Q4 of Scientific Journal Rankings (SJR), as well as 1 article in the edition indexed in Russian Science Citation Index/RSCI.).\n2. The obtained fundamental results will be discussed at international and all-Russian conferences (3 events, for example: Siberian Thermophysical Seminar; School-Seminar of young scientists and specialists under the guidance of Academician A.I. Leontiev \"Problems of Gas Dynamics and Heat and Mass Transfer in Power Plants\"; 16th International Conference on Thermal Engineering, Theory and Applications; XXII International Conference of Students, Postgraduates and Young Scientists\"Prospects of Development of Fundamental Sciences\").\n3. The developed computing codes will be fixed in the form of 2 certificates on state registration of computer programs.\n4. As a result of work on the project modern mathematical models of unsteady laminar modes of natural convective heat transfer of fluid with variable properties in passive cooling systems with heating elements and porous layers will be developed and implemented, taking into account the peculiarities of interaction at interfacial boundaries and in the porous structure. The numerical techniques will be based on the finite difference method and a thorough verification of the developed method will be carried out. On the basis of the obtained results on the influence of determining parameters on the characteristics of heat exchange in closed systems, recommendations for the design and optimization of thermal systems will be formulated. All the results obtained as a result of the project realization, based on the problem statements and methods of their solution, will have novelty and correspond to the world level. The results will be published in leading foreign and domestic journals, as well as approved at Russian/international conferences."
