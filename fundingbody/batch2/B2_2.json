				"value": "The University of Auckland was formally opened on 23 May 1883 as Auckland University College, part of the University of New Zealand. A disused courthouse and jail served as premises for the 95 students and four teaching staff.The roll increased slowly but steadily during the remainder of the 19th century; by 1901 it had risen to 156 students.A surge of interest in academic research at the University arose during the Depression of the early 1930s.The 1950s were a difficult period in the history of the University of Auckland: the roll had soared after World War II, reaching 4000 by 1959, and buildings were inadequate and overcrowded.The period of intensive new construction, begun in the 1960s, drew to a close with completion of the new School of Music in 1986 and the Marae complex in 1988. Education and the Law School moved into a new precinct in 1992.Today, the University of Auckland is the largest university in New Zealand, hosting over 40,000 students on five Auckland campuses"
