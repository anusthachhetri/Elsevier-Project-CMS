## RELAX NG Schema for HTML 5 Core Profile
# #####################################################################

# To validate an HTML 5 document, you must first validate against  #
# this schema and then ALSO validate against assertions.sch        #
## HTML flavor RELAX NG schemas can only be used after the         #
## document has been transformed to well-formed XML.               #
##   - Insert closing slashes in all empty element tags            #
##   - Insert all optional start and end tags                      #
##   - Add xmlns "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"                    #
##   - Properly escape <script> and <style> CDATA                  #
##   - Parse and transform all HTML-only entities to numeric       #
##     character references                                        #
## Obviously, syntax-checking involving these features cannot be   #
## done by the RELAX NG schema and must be checked, along with the #
## <!DOCTYPE> requirement, by some other application.              #
